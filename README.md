# KITTY V2: Intelligent Security Ecosystem with Dragon Tunnel Core

## Overview

**KITTY V2** is an advanced intelligent security platform developed to safeguard high-value data streams, control critical processes, and adapt dynamically to evolving threats.  
At the heart of this ecosystem lies the **Dragon Tunnel (DNK-6)** ‚Äî a sophisticated multi-layer cryptographic system equipped with autonomous defenses and a unique internal routing protocol called **Kosichka**.

## Key Components

### üêâ Dragon Tunnel (DNK-6)
- **Dynamic multi-layer scale architecture:**  
  Inspired by biological scales, protective layers continuously mutate and reposition, preventing static analysis and complicating unauthorized forensic inspection.

- **Kosichka internal braid protocol:**  
  Secure payloads are split into intertwined segments, traveling through pseudo-random channels inside the tunnel. Reconstruction occurs only at the secure endpoint, ensuring interception along any single path reveals nothing useful.

- **Sykov decoy streams:**  
  Additional false data tunnels designed to divert attention from genuine transmissions, increasing attack complexity.

- **Autonomous rollback & hash monitoring:**  
  The system validates itself in real-time using cryptographic hashes. If anomalies are detected, it automatically reverts to the last confirmed secure state.

- **Threat intelligence adaptation:**  
  Regularly integrates data from trusted online security feeds and anti-malware databases, dynamically reinforcing defenses against newly discovered attacks.

### üß† KITTY V2 Supervisor
KITTY V2 acts as the broader intelligent control layer ‚Äî managing operations, overseeing behavioral analytics, and orchestrating strategic decisions.  
Within KITTY V2, the **Dragon Tunnel** serves as the primary secure conduit, making them a unified, self-adaptive ecosystem capable of withstanding sophisticated multi-vector attacks.
